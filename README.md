# odin-recipes
This Project is the first "big" Project in "The Odin Project" (theodinproject.com). 

It will teach me how to use git, HTML and CSS. To be precise: ordered- and unordered lists. Pictures and links. 

The Assignement is to build a recipe website with a few pages, that link to each other.
